    "# 🦜🔗 Conversational RAG with LangChain, Groq, and ChromaDB\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Overview**\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. The system allows users to chat with external documents (in this case, a technical blog post) that the LLM was not explicitly trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Technologies:**\n",
    "* **LangChain:** For orchestration and chain management.\n",
    "* **Groq (Llama 3):** For ultra-fast LLM inference.\n",
    "* **HuggingFace:** For generating open-source text embeddings.\n",
    "* **ChromaDB:** As the local vector store for semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Architecture**\n",
    "1.  **Ingest:** Load data from a URL.\n",
    "2.  **Split:** Chunk the text into manageable pieces.\n",
    "3.  **Embed:** Convert chunks into vectors using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.\n",
    "4.  **Store:** Save vectors in ChromaDB.\n",
    "5.  **Retrieve:** Fetch relevant context based on user queries.\n",
    "6.  **Generate:** Use Llama-3 via Groq to answer questions using the retrieved context."
