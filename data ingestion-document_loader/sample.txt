‘Good morning Principal Sir, teachers, and my dear friends. Today, I stand before you to present my speech about life. We all want a successful life so that we can live a happy and material life. But, what is the meaning of life? Is life only about happiness, joy, and materialistic things?’

‘Happiness and material needs are our desires offered by life as a reward for our hard work and luck. Life is a challenging journey. Sometimes there are clouds of darkness, lost in shadows. However, even in times like these, life teaches us to discover our inner strength, resilience, and the capacity to emerge into the light with newfound wisdom and growth.’

Everybody has a purpose in their lives and to fulfill them, we have to fight our own battles. We have to study hard to succeed in exams, practice deliberately to win a competition, etc. Life is challenging, but that is what makes life so special. 

Edmund Hillary and Tibetan mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, the first persons to climb the highest mountain peak, Mount Everest, failed 6 times. He, along with Edmund Hillary, finally climbed to the top of the Everest in their 7th attempt. They knew about the challenges and difficulties that would come with their mission, but they still did the impossible.
